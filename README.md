Use [JSXGraph](https://github.com/jsxgraph/jsxgraph "Title") (Possibly [Matter.js](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js "Title"), [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/ "Title"), [d3-force-3d](https://github.com/vasturiano/d3-force-3d), or Geogebra) to create equation visualization. Use Vue for frontend development.
