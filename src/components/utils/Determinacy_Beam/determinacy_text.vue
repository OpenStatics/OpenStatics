    To ensure the equilibrium of a rigid body, it is not only necessary to satisfy the equations of equilibrium, but the body must also be properly
    held or constrained by its supports. Some bodies may have more supports than are necessary for equilibrium, whereas others may not have enough or
    the supports may be arranged in a particular manner that could cause the body to move. \[FilledCircle] If a body is supported by constraints that
    yield more unknown reactive forces than available equations of equilibrium, then it is statically indeterminate. \[FilledCircle] If a body is
    supported by constraints that yield a minimum number of reactive forces to ensure equilibrium, then it is statically determinate. \[FilledCircle]
    If a body is supported by constraints that yield fewer reactive forces than equations of equilibrium that must be satisfied, then it is partially
    constrained and statically unstable.
